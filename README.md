# An-N-Body-Gravitational-Simulation
# N-Body Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates the motion of N celestial bodies under the influence of gravitational forces using Python. The simulation leverages the Pygame library for visualization and NumPy for numerical computations. This project is an excellent showcase of combining physics, mathematics, and programming to simulate complex systems.

## Features
- **Gravitational Force Calculation**: Calculates the gravitational force between each pair of celestial bodies.
- **Verlet Integration**: Uses Verlet integration to update the positions and velocities of the bodies, ensuring stable numerical solutions.
- **Visualization**: Provides a visual representation of the simulation using the Pygame library.
- **Toggle Simulation**: Start and pause the simulation with the spacebar key.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pygame**: A cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games.
- **NumPy**: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Install Dependencies
You can install the required libraries using pip:
```sh
